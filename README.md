# YTDLUI
YTDLUI or Youtube Downloader UI is a UI-based YouTube downloader that directly downloads any YouTube public/unlisted video(videos that require you to log in have planned to be supported but are not yet supported).
It allows you to choose between different codecs, bitrates, and more that YouTube supplies directly.
And you can also download only audio or only video parts of you so desire!
YTDLUI does not rerender or convert any videos!

## Requirements
- .NET 6 or higher (.NET 7 is recommended)
- FFmpeg
- yt-dlp

FFmpeg and yt-dlp can be replaced if the replacing program can run and accept the same commands they use

## Installing
No need to install YTDLUI, just run the program which you can download over at "Releases".
However for YTDLUI to work the binaries for FFmpeg and yt-dlp must be in the same directory as YTDLUI or be listed in the global "path" environment.
